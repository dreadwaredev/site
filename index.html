    <div class="post-content"><h2 id="the-past">The Past</h2>
<p>My very first home computer was a Windows 95 machine which crashed frequently. I upgraded to Windows ME which made things worse, but I was young and had time. I ended up learning a lot to play Diablo 2 without losing my hardcore character to lag or crashes. I can still vividly remember the horror of hearing &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gYEFASEvXg">Looking for Baal</a>&quot; as the screen stayed black. The internet was still in its infancy; there was no AI, no Google. I just had to try stuff until it worked.</p>
<p>When I got to college I used Windows XP. The OS crashes were mostly gone and software seemed to work. Hardware kept getting faster and software kept getting more stable. Things were good and the future was bright!</p>
<p>For my C++ course work, we were instructed to use an IDE called Quincy which was primitive by modern standards. It crashed all the time (but Windows didn't) and I learned the hard way that pressing CTRL+S every few seconds was essential. This is a habit I continue to this day, although most modern software autosaves. Even with all these problems, I don't ever remember feeling discouraged when it came to programming, or about computers in general.</p>
<h2 id="the-present">The Present</h2>
<p>Now it's 2025. I've been using Windows 11 and Visual Studio for a long time and I have grey hair. I find myself frequently feeling discouraged whenever I sit down to program. Time is now far more scarce than when I was young and every minute that I waste with OS updates and slowness feels excruciating. It's frustrating and makes me want to quit. Modern software is over complicated and it sucks! Even <a href="https://x.com/WindowsLatest/status/1991952313217638540">opening a folder takes forever</a> on a modern gaming system! At least I'm <a href="https://x.com/ryanjfleury/status/1992373926509551765">not alone</a> <a href="https://x.com/Jonathan_Blow/status/1985114439805550952">in feeling</a> <a href="https://x.com/cmuratori/status/1949880554079605145">this way</a>.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, I started using tools that were built by people who care about time. I started using <a href="https://10xeditor.com/">10x Editor</a> and <a href="https://remedybg.itch.io/remedybg">RemedyBG</a> to make coding tolerable again. I use <a href="https://filepilot.tech/">File Pilot</a> to avoid the feeling of walking through tar with explorer.exe. But somehow, Windows 11 keeps getting worse and I keep noticing.</p>
<p><strong>I can still remember the days before things were so broken and complicated!</strong> So, instead of looking forward I started looking back.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Inspired by the numinous John Carmack quote above, I bought a cheap PC to serve as my primary programming machine and put Windows 10 LTSC on it. I briefly tried to install Linux but none of my attempts were successful. Some distros wouldn't even install on the hardware I was using. I actually blame Microsoft and Intel for this since I think many of the problems involve things like &quot;TPM&quot; or &quot;UEFI&quot; or whatever other complex BIOS junk that exists today. I do not have a deep knowledge of chipset/BIOS minutia, and I'm too old to have interest in learning it. I want to program, I don't want to be a system admin.</p>
<p>I used that machine for about a year, and things were mostly good. However, LTSC still has an expiration date, and <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/top-11-things-we-dont-about-windows-10/">Windows 10 is still not fun</a>. I thought hard about the last time I had a good experience with a computer, and it was when Windows 7 was in its prime. It smoothed over many of the problems Vista introduced and mostly just got out of my way. It didn't have the modern Windows telemetry nightmare. It was stable. Software mostly worked. So I decided to try an experiment and give Windows 7 another try.</p>
<p>Immediately I discovered that the machine I was using wouldn't work because it was too new, so I bought something old and installed Windows 7. The PC has no wireless network adapter, which is excellent for me since putting this device online might destroy it. The software I use seems to still have support for Windows 7, even if unofficially. Unfortunately, 10x Editor does not render correctly which leaves me heartbroken.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>So what can I do? I need an editor that respects me and my time, which narrows it down to very few. I used to use <a href="https://4coder.net/">4Coder</a>, but it's long since been discontinued. There is a <a href="https://github.com/4coder-community/4cc">community version</a>, so I gave that shot. Unfortunately, installing Build Tools for Visual Studio on an offline machine wouldn't work for me, even when using the fancy command line flags to create an offline installer. This leaves me concerned since I typically use Microsoft's compiler. I will try GCC to see if I have better luck, but for now I have no code editor and no compiler.</p>
<p>So what's left? If I think about what I need in an editor, it's actually very little:</p>
<ul>
<li>type text</li>
<li>copy and paste</li>
<li>support keyboard shortcuts.</li>
<li>launch a .bat to compile my code when I press CTRL+B</li>
</ul>
<p>Syntax highlighting might be nice but isn't required. I just want to type, compile, and run programs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://focus-editor.dev/">Focus editor</a> sounds great, but doesn't run on Windows 7. I'm not cool enough or smart enough to learn emacs.</p>
<p>I think I'll just write my own.</p>
